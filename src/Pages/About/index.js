                    Hi my name is Verna Heyne. I am a current student in the Butler Bootcamp Coding Certificate program. I will graduate in less than a month and I am looking for a junior coding position. I have had previous HTML coding experience and newly versed in CSS, JavaScript, React, APIs, Node.js, Graphql, MERN, and many other coding platforms. I am looking for a position that will allow me the flexibility to hone my coding skills as well as providing customers with an oustanding website for their business!

        </section>
